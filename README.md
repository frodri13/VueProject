# VueProject

This is my first Vue project.

I created a simple Random User Generator with the `https://randomuser.me/api` api.

## How to Use?

Just clone this project, open it in your favorite text-editor. I like VSCode. And use the Open With Live Server Plugin.

Once the project is being rendered on your browser. Go ahead a click the `Get Random User` button and see the magic happen.

## Tutorial

I followed along this Vue Crash Course on YouTube `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs`
